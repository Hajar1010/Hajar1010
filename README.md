# 👋 Hi there, I'm Hajar!

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student learning to build fun and useful things with Python.    
💡 I enjoy working on mini-games, command-line apps, and interactive tools.  
🌱 Currently improving my skills in logic, clean code, and GitHub workflows.  
🎮 I’ve built things like a password strength checker, a word scrambler, and a roulette game!

- 🔐 [Password Checker](https://github.com/Hajar1010/password-checker): checks strength of a password
- 🧠 [Mystery Word Game](https://github.com/Hajar1010/guess-the-word):guess the word (WORDLE_STYLE)
